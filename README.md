## Regarding 5 months wit no updates and the latest The Browser Company® news

Yes, i've seen the news and the community going crazy on their reddit, discord and pretty much anywhere and i agree with all fo it. The beginning of this project used to have in the readme a text explaining how i planned to abandom this after arc for windows and how you should still test arc if you can. I have nothing to do with The Browser Company® or any affiliate of it. I was just inspired by arc UI and wanted to have a browser UI like the one on arc for mac on windows before arc for windows was even a thing. I just wanted a UI like arc on mac os that i could use on windows. because of my job, my wedding and some other things i coudn't do much for this. i coudn't rebuild it to be actually good instead of iterating on top of the first workaround i did as a joke and got too big. I even tried to start BetterBrowser on the middle of it. and i coudn't. And i'm sorry for that.

After all these news and stuff, i've decided to get back and actually start BetterBrowser and make things better. I'll be announcing stuff soon and i hope to get y'all on discord helping me keep it up. I love y'all for never giving up like i did. and i'm sorry. Hope we'll make an amazing thing in the future.

niko.
