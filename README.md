# What is ArcFox?

ArcFox is a pack of firefox improvements that brings the appearance and some of the features of arc browser to firefox. Developed by a non-profit community of passionate browser enthusiats to let people experience arc through their favorite browser.

> I really recomend you to give a try on arc browser anyways.

Please refer to the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/betterbrowser/projects/2/views/3) to check the development or our [discord](https://discord.gg/jDASpgt68t) for helps and leaks :D
