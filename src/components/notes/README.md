Features:

- [x] Share Notes
- [x] Keep notes on refresh
- [ ] Rich-text and Markdown features
- [ ] Dynamic color (ArcFox)

This project uses SvelteJS, build it using:
```
npm install
npm run build
```
if you see an error while running the local build, that's because Firefox blocks inline javascript, so put all your code on a separate file;

This is meant to run locally on the browser, built into the ArcFox Extension
