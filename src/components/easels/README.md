## ArcFox Easels - the official open-source Easel system for [ArcFox](https://github.com/betterbrowser/arcfox)

Hey there! This is a very early version of Easels, so a lot of features are missing.

It uses SvelteJS, build it using:

```
npm install
npm run build
```
if you see an error while running the local build, that's because Firefox blocks inline javascript, so put all your code on a separate file;

This is meant to run locally on the browser, built into the ArcFox Extension
Feel free to contribute by making changes or adding features!
